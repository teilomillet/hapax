# Hapax Development Roadmap

## Vision
Hapax is the reliability layer between your code and LLM providers. We're building an open-source infrastructure layer that makes LLM operations robust and predictable. Our goal is to provide the tools and visibility you need to run AI applications with confidence, whether you're a solo developer or running large-scale deployments.

### Core Principles
- **Reliability**: Smart provider management for uninterrupted operations
- **Visibility**: Clear insights into your LLM infrastructure
- **Flexibility**: Adaptable to your security and scaling needs
- **Simplicity**: Complex infrastructure made approachable
