# Hapax Development Roadmap

## Vision
Build a production-grade LLM gateway that makes deploying and managing LLM infrastructure as simple as running NGINX, while maintaining enterprise-grade reliability, security, and observability.

## Phase 1: Core Gateway Functionality
Focus: Build a reliable, production-ready gateway server leveraging gollm's capabilities.

### 1.1 Server Foundation
- [x] Basic HTTP server implementation
- [x] Configuration system
- [x] Middleware architecture
  - Request ID generation
  - Request timing
  - Panic recovery
  - CORS support
- [x] Enhanced error handling
  - Custom error types
  - Error response formatting
  - Error logging with context
- [ ] Request validation
  - Input sanitization
  - Schema validation
  - Content-type verification

### 1.2 Gateway Features
- [ ] Route management
  - Dynamic routing based on request properties
  - Version management (v1, v2, etc.)
  - Health check endpoints
- [ ] Request processing
  - Request transformation
  - Response formatting
  - Streaming support
- [ ] Provider management
  - Provider configuration
  - Provider health monitoring
  - Failover handling

### 1.3 Essential Security & Operations
- [ ] Authentication system
  - API key validation
  - Key management
  - Usage tracking per key
- [ ] Rate limiting
  - Per-client limits
  - Token bucket implementation
  - Configurable limits
- [ ] Basic monitoring
  - Request metrics
  - Latency tracking
  - Error rate monitoring

## Phase 2: Production Readiness
- Prometheus metrics integration
- Load balancing
- Circuit breakers
- Request queueing
- Configuration hot reload
- Docker support

## Phase 3: Enterprise Features
- Role-based access control
- Audit logging
- Cluster mode
- Advanced rate limiting
- Response caching
- Custom routing rules

## Phase 4: Enterprise Scale
- Performance optimization
- Enterprise authentication
- Admin dashboard
- Cost management
- SLA monitoring

## Success Metrics
- Installation time < 5 minutes
- Configuration requires no code changes
- 99.9% uptime
- < 100ms added latency
- Zero security vulnerabilities
- Automatic failure recovery

## Future Considerations
- Multi-region support
- Custom model hosting
- A/B testing support
- Model performance analytics
- Fine-tuning integration

## Notes
- Security and reliability improvements will be ongoing
- Each feature includes appropriate testing and documentation
- Regular security audits throughout development
- Features may be reprioritized based on user feedback
